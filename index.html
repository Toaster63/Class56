<h1>Why I Like Percy Jackson & the Olympians</h1>
<img src="Percy.jpg">
<p>There are many reasons I like Percy Jackson & the Olympians. It has a good story that kept me hooked and made me read for hours. It had good action that kept me on my toes. It was a fun journey and was masterfully written. If only there was a sequel. Wait, there is!</p>
